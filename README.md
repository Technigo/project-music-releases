# Music Releases
Pair programming project using a (local) database to pull out album and artist, presenting it as a responsive display with album covers, titles and artist links. To be done with React, using JSX and HTML/CSS. We were also introduced to new tools such as npm.

This project was built by https://github.com/AschwinSiaila and https://github.com/vrill/.

## The problem
Initially we had some issues with getting npm to work correctly. This was necessary in order to write the application according to spec, using the above mentioned languages.

React teaches us to use components, and this was a challenge to know what to break up into a component and what wasn't needed to. And also how things were supposed to be imported/exported back and forth.

With a lot of data in the data.json file to parse through and present, it needed to be well structured and defined what type and kind of data we were looking for. With React 'requiring' components, it did help a bit do keep a good structure and not be overwhelmed by code.

We started off by going after the Blue level requirements, one by one, in order to have a path to go down and not feel overwhelmed. Slowly but surely we managed to get the page looking like the mock-ups and even move on to implement the requirements of the Red level.

We tried a lot of different JavaScript code in order to meet the "," and "&" goal, but eventually found a very elegant solution using CSS.

I think if we had more time (life happens...) we definitely would want to reach the stretch goals of the Black level. We felt very confident in the application we wrote, but could most likely achieve more.
