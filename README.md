# Music Releases
Practicing ReactJS Component, Props and mapping

## The problem
Problem with mapping different Components inside App.js so we decided to use only one Component and map the Artists there, which worked in the end. 

Had problem with the album hover which the icon div doesn't cover the size of the album. We in the end gave the album div a width and height, and allow the icon div to cover 100% when album is hovered. 

Had problem with getting the "," and "&" to show up at the right place, in the end StackOver Flow had the solution for us (https://stackoverflow.com/c/technigo/questions/2239).
