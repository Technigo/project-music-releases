# Music Releases ðŸŽ¶

This week's project was all about getting started with React and build a "New Releases" music site. We created components by using data from Spotify and created a page which shows new album and single releases.

## The problem

The problems that we experienced this week had to do with npm install, node-modules and to deploy to Netlify. We got really stuck but eventuelly we found what the problem was.
