# Music Releases
This project was about building a new albums and singles releases app with React. 

## The problem

When we started this project we started to fetch the data by importing the data to each component. Later we learned how to only import the data in the first compontent only and then use props to send the data to the other components.

Technologies used in this project:

CSS
JavaScript
React
JSX
API
