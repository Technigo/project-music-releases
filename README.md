# Music Releases
In this assignment we were supposed to build a music release app in React

## The problem

This was a pair-programming assignment so we started off coding together in the master branch. And because we are based in different parts of the world we kept working on our own in the master branch when the companion was sleeping.

We started working with the app.js and then added components until we had all the data we needed to start styling.

We started to style the index.css but soon realized that we should style the different components in their folder.
