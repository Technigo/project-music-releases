# Music Releases
Project done by both Jennifer Feenstra-Arengård and Eva Sjöholm
 
We used React and data from Spotify to create a page with new albums and single releases. 

## The problem
Using pair programming we first attempted to use react components to display album images and artists names which can be clicked to bring the user into respective spotify page. In addition we used css to style the page and make it responsive. 

 If we had more time we could make the icons responsive/clickable.
