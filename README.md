# Music Releases

This project was to build a page which shows new album and single releases using React and creating components by data from Spotify.
It was a pair programming project made by Harry Bäcklin and Ida Aspen.

## The problem

The challenge was to structure the code and break down the project to different components which needed to be mounted for each album card.
