# 'New Releases' music site build using React ðŸŽµðŸŽ¨

I build a responsive music app for mobile, tablets and laptops. I used React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases, and the response from Spotify API to fetched the data.

When user hovers over an album, the play button is showed. The button is linked to album's external url from Spotify. User also can click on artist and it links to the artist's page on Spotify.

App is responsive.
