# Music Releases

This project was to practice React and creating components by using data from Spotify. 

## The problem

With pairprogramming, StackOverflow and team mates we solved this weeks task. We used React, CSS and a lot of trial and error. We practised the hover effect alot. 

If we had more time we would fix the last row, so it is focused on the left.
