# Music Releases

This a responsive webpage with music releases.
Each album card has a cover image, some icons on it, album's name and artist's name.
There was a design sketch that we had to follow with some hovering effects and animation.

## The problem

This project was done in a pair-programmimg remote setup.
The planning went like this:
We made a sketch in Jamboard and then decided on the components and the general structure.
We displayed a gallery of albums and some data that was taken from an API and stored in a file.
The page is responsive.
We used React and CSS.
For the layout we applyed flexbox.  
We had some data to display which was stored in arrays and in order to do that we used the map function.
