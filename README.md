The project should fulfill the **ðŸ”µ  Blue Level** and all of the **General Requirements.** Use the **ðŸ”´  Red Level** and **âš«  Black Level** to push your knowledge to the next level!

## **General Requirements**

- Publish your site on Netlify.

## **ðŸ”µ  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

- Your app should have components
- *Your page should look as close as possible to the design provided*.
- You should display the following for each album:
    - album cover image
    - album name
    - the name of each artist involved with a comma between
- Hover effects:
    - When you hover over an album, it should go darker, and you should show a play button, a favourite button, and the ellipsis (see the design sketch)
    - When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketch)
    - Hovering an artist name or an album name should match the design sketch
- When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external url in the data
- When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external url in the data
- Your page should be responsive:
    - showing 4 albums per row on desktop
    - 2 per row on tablet
    - 1 per row on mobile.


## **ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**

- Create CSS rules or Javascript logic so that if there are only two artists you show a "&" between them, and if there are more than two artists, you show "," between all artists except the last two which should have "&":
    - *Teyana Taylor & Kehlani*
    - *Y2K, bbno$ & Enrique Iglesias*
- Lower the opacity of the play button icons and then when you hover over the play button, it should have full opacity

## **âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals)**

- We've provided another API response which includes a list of popular playlists. Use this, along with some new components to render a list of playlists in a sidebar.
- Sort the albums from the singles and create two different sections on your site
- Incorporate more information from the API response to make your site richer
