# Music Releases
The goal of this project was to showcase Spotify Data with JSX and React. 

## The problem
This was the first time we used React and JSX so we had to start with reading up on components, props and the slightly new aspects to JSX. We also needed to start with understanding how to structure our project in components and what data to store where. In the end we really enjoyed this new structure and also how helpful React is to your work method.
