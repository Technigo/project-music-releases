Description

In this project I built a page which shows new album and single releases using React components.

What did I do?

First I created React components. Then I used `.map` to iterate over an array of data and mount many components. I used React props to feed information to components. The project was built though structuring React projects into small chunks.

If I had more time I would of added a playlist sidebar.
