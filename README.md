# Music Releases
The task this week was to create a site in React displaying music releases, using an API from Spotify. It was done with pair programming by Matilda Frid and Camilla Cronqvist.

## The problem

The main focus this week was to practice using React and building a site with components. We started building the base together with a pair programming approach, and then divided the components and their styling between us.
