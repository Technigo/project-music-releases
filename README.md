# Music Releases

For this project we used React and components to build a page that shows new album and single releases. The data we used was fetched from Spotify's api.

The webpage was created by Anna Dimitrakopoulos and Ebba Delsol with pair programming.

## The problem

We approached the project by starting to get all the information we wanted from the data.json and create various React components. Later on we began styling the page as similar as possible to the given sketch. During the styling we found a problem with one of the albums overlay and figured it was related to the length of the artist name. We fixed the problem by setting a defined width of the parent container. Tools we used to find answers during the project were google-search and stack-overflow.
