# Music Releases

Built a New Releases music site with React by using data from Spotify. It was built to show new albums, singles, and playlist releases. This project was a collaboration between Rawi and Savannah, accomplished by pair programming.

## The problem

We first displayed the data we needed from a downloaded response, json file from the Spotify API. The reason being that this week we focused on React, rather than to fetch data from an API. Then we focused on creating components and passed the data we needed into each component. 

We decided to add an album, artist, and playlist component which rendered each item in the data array to show the album, artist, and playlist details. After structuring our code and displaying the data, we focused on styling with a mobil first approach. If we had more time, we would probably fetch the data from Spotify's API.
