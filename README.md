# Music Releases

This week's project was to build a "New Releases" music site with React. We were tasked to create a page by using data fetched from Spotify and style it according to the design included in the project files.

## The problem

This has been our first project using React, so adjusting to this new method of coding has been a bit of a challenge overall. We made sure to go through the given material before starting to code and planned times where we could meet up and code together as well as what each person could do on their own, since it's been a bit difficult getting our schedules to align at times. 

In React, special characters such as commas and ampersands proved a bit tricky to implement, since certain code had to be included for it rather than just using it in a p-tag. 

One way to solve it was through CSS, while another only used JavaScript. We ended up trying a few of them before settling for one that worked best in the end.

If we've had more time, we might have looked at some of the Intermediary and Advanced goals and see whether it'd be a good idea to tackle them.
