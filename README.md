# Music Releases

The assignment was to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.

## The problem

We created three components; one for album card, one that holds the artist info, and one for the icons overlay. We also added one CSS file for each component.
If we had more time we would have added more components (e.g. album cover) to get a better structure.
