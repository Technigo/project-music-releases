# Music Releases
This project we practiced React and created components by using data from Spotify. We build a page which shows new album and single releases. 
This project was done by Maria Thomasson and Birgit Nehrwein.

## The problem

We build the site using three components (Album.js, Artist.js and Header.js) in React. It was a challenge to understand where to add what in the different files that we created.
We used ressources from Stack Overflow, Slack and Github for our project.
If we had more time, we would add render a list of playlists in a sidebar.
