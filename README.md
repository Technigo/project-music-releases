# Music Releases

This projects was done during the Technigo Bootcamp and is our introduction to React.
It was developed using Pair programming in a team of two ( Sandra Shumanteva and Moa Hammarb√§ck ).

## The problem

We build a copy of Spotify using React and we started with looking through the npm and what
the package.json file represents and contains. Then we got familiar with npm install and npm start commands.

Next step was that we started with collecting the Data from the Spotify API and stored it in our Card component before exporting it to the main App component. We are using props and we generate HTML elements to show each Album's cover image, name and artists with the map function. We also learned how to give elements a class on React by using keyword className.

The page is responsive and we have some hover effects on the different Album covers, underline for the Artist name and song title, links to the album/artist and a growing play button also on hover.
