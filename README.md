# Music Releases


This week the project was creating a music release app with react, and connecting components to app.js

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We had alot of challenges, that we worked throu togheter, we ended on a "high note" on tuesday. But redid everything from scratch on thursday, to make it actually work. Because of our lack of basic react&Js 
knowledge, so sometimes we didn't even know where to start trouble shoot and solve it. The tools we used are google, and Daniels videos, also speaking to diffrent teammembers for tips and tricks.
We planned to be almost done on thursday (which we almost where even with the "restart" :)

If we had more time:
-Make the basic knowledge stick before jumping in directly on the assignment :)
-experiment more with props, trying more things.a
