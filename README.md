## Project 7: Music Releases

This is a pair-programming based project. It is a page with music releases.
Each album card has a cover image, some icons on it, album's name and artist's name.
There was a design sketch that we had to follow with some hovering effects and animation.

## The process

1. We made a sketch in Jamboard and then decided on the components and the general structure.
2. We displayed a gallery of albums and some data that was taken from an API and stored in a file.
3. Made the page responsive.

## Focus
* JavaScript functions
* React and React components
 
## Challenges to solve

Make a better alignments and maybe add a loader.
