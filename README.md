## Spotify Releases Project
The brief was to use React to create a responsive site that showed either 1, 2, or 4 album or song cards (mobile, tablet, and desktop respectively) from Spotify. We were also supposed to create hover effects with a play icon that expands, as well as links to the individual artists on each track.

## Problem & Solution

I first built the components that sorted the albums from the singles into two different categories. After that, I wanted to implement a carousel instead of a long list - so I added react-flickity-component to the package.json and installed it. After that, I spent some more time trying to figure out how I could further divide the components more elegantly so I could re-use them.

I had a lot of fun learning about props and props children for this project.

The above link is for the project with the carousel. The link below is a branch I created with the Technigo requirements (to display all of the albums and singles at once). 

If you'd like to see a live link and my code for the Technigo requirements version, you can check out the "technigo" branch on my github repo below.
