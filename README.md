# Music Releases
This project is a pairproject buy Leo Thunell and Nora Terbocs using react, javascript and css. 

## The problem

Based on the project brief and the design images we started to plan what components we should create in order to copy the given style. 
We have iterated through the given API response with the map method and with grid and flexbox we positioned the components and elements.
