# Music Releases

Pair project by Daniel Vestin & Pinar Demirel for making an app built with React to present recent Albums & Singles from a Spotify api.

## The problem

First we tried to find where the data we wanted to use were located in the Json.
After we located the data we started to map() it as props for the Album.js component, also made a map for when there was more than one artist. We then styled those situations to add "&" and "," with CSS.
If we had more time we would've wanted to add more components for seperated albums/singles and a playlist or so.
