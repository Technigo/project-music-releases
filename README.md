# Music Releases
This project assignment was to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases, using a downloaded response from the Spotify API.

## The problem

This was our first project coding with React and we used .map() to iterate data from Spotify API. 
We started by doing a component called Album where we used props to pass the correct data from the data.json file. 
We also structured our main component by using JSX.
To position the albums and have the site responsive we used flexbox.
The task was to apply different hovering effects on the links and icons. We struggled to get all the effects to work on the icons, but after getting some help we managed to solve the problem according to the brief.
