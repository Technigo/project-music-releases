# Music Releases
This week we have practice React and creating components by using data from Spotify.

## The problem

First we identified which components we needed. We decided to start with the App, Album and Artist components and then we created the Header and Icon part.
After we got the data we needed from the API we styled the page so it followed the desired design.
