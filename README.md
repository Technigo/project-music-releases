# Music Releases
MUSIC RELEASES: This project was a pair-programming project with Jessica Falk and Lena Simma, The aim of the project was to build a music site giving an overview on 10 album releases using JSX and React components. 

## The problem

The challenge was to fetch information from a data set using a map function to iterate over an array as well as mounting several components.
This is the very first project using React and it was challenging to get used to the new structure especially in regard to the components. But we managed and are very happy with the result. You can have a look hear.
