# Music Releases

Mission for this project was to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases. üéß
This was a pair-programming project.

## The problem

We (Team Tuliany & P√•l) started off by reading the mission brief together. We also teamed up with the others in our group to discuss and code.
We configured VS code for live coding and Whereby as a platform for communication and screen sharing.
We got stuck a few times and if we had some more time we would put this into getting the .map() of the artist array to work. This is on the list for the future.
And a sidebar would be great to put in there. But for now we are pretty happy with the result and look forward moving on learning more React! ‚òÄÔ∏è
