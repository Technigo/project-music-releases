# Music Releases
The task was to create a webpage using React and a Spotify API. From the API we were supposed get the album-title, artist's name and the cover image for the album and display them in a way that reminded of how Spotify displays it. 

## The problem

We started with creating the function that maps the API and brings out each album. This was done in the App.js file. After, we sent the information into the different components Artist, Album and Covers. These components each returned a more specified value back to the App.js using react. We only used named export for the project.

We decided to go with CSS grid when designing the page. We installed react bootstrap and imported some icons from it. We first imported a part that reset the CSS but that just messed things up so we removed it. The bootstrap made it possible to get the icons that we wanted and it also made it really easy to manipulate them. 

The last thing we decided to add was the release date of the album displayed. This was just for fun and to try what else we could display from the API.
