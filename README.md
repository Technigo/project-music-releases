# Music Releases
This week we will practice React and creating components by using data from Spotify. 
We builded a page which shows new album and single releases. This was a team task so I worked with Ajmal. We worked as a team from monday to thursday, but decided on friday's standup that we will both finnish the project individually to get more practice working with css. The project was nice and everything went super smoothly with Ajmal.

## The problem

First it was super hard to understand how React works but after seeing some code from previous student we startted to understand more and more. We tried tto work as much as possible simultaniusly with the same file, so we ecould share the knowledge while working. On friady I spent some time to look how Spotify API works if I want to update this project later to constantly updating version with my own playlists.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
