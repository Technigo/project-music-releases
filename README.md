# Music Releases
This is a page built with React using data from Spotify. The page shows new album and single releases.
The project was a pair programming one and we worked with a lot of commits and PRs. 

## The problem

We built the project in different phases. 
First we identified which components we needed. We decided to start with the App, Album and Artist components. We later created an Icon and a Footer component since we felt these were re usable. 

After we got the data we needed from the API response we moved into CSS and specifically the Hover effects. 
We ended the project with Flexbox and styling some more so the page followed the desired design.
