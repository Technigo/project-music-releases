# Music Releases

The assignment was to create a React application that would showcase Spotify albums and singles from a json data already provided.

## The problem

### Tools and Techniques

- React framework
- Lighthouse extension for accessiblity rating
- React developer tools

### Planning

Regarding planing we started by planing our pair programming sessions. Thanks to having a design template we decided to first start with creating enough components that we then could style to have a base. Once we had a base styling with functioning components we then went back to create more components to optimize the build or our React app.

### Approach to the problem

We were able to use React with json files already provided. We mapped the data using `.map()` method in order to get the data we needed. Then we made components for each section simplifing our react build for easier future adaptations.

### Future Improvements

If we had more time the next steps for us would be to implement a player interface in the header that would play any of the albums or singles when pressing upon the play button.

- heading with fixed positions
- play buttons that links to the songs in Spotify
- Sort the albums from the songs and make proper sections for these components
- Create our own object containing our Spotify playlists from personal accounts
