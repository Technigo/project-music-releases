# Music Releases

This project served as an introduction to React, where we learned how to use components and props.

## The problem

We started by destructuring the design we were given and deciding on which components we needed to build, and in which dependency. After building the components we added the props.
Our work was very organised from the beginning, as we were planning to reach the black levels goals, so we kept those in mind while building the basic structure. Our goal was to be able to reuse the components of the basic structure for the black level goals, which we also achieved.
