# Music Releases
This is a pair-programming project and the task was to build a Music Release site by using pre-fetched data from an API from Spotify.


## The problem

We started by scetching up all of the requirements for the project on a Trello board to get an overview, and then we decided where to start.
We created components to display the album data and used .map to print out the data that we were supposed to. 
We were not sure of how to import components from one file to another so we wrote a question on Stack Overflow and got some help to solve it.
We finished the project by adding all of the styling in CSS, where we also added the hover effects.
