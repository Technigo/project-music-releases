My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
It took us some time to get a structure of the components, it helped a lot working
in a team where we could discuss our challenges regarding this.
This project taught us a lot about the basics in React and also how to style the components.


This project was done by:
Therese Nyman, Katarina Elgerus and Hanna Wallberg
