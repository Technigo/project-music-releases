# Music Releases

We were asked to use an API to create a website outlining the newest releases in Spotify. The website had to contain pictures and info on each album/single and artist.

## The problem

First we began by dividing up the components as we saw fit and trying to connect them all to App.js. This was the first hurdle that required us to get into the mindset of React, and was quite hard. When this was done the rest of the assignment ran quite smoothly.

We planned by discussing the different options for components (did we want a separate compotent to contain the .maps() or should they be in App.js?) and landed in the attached solution.

If we had more time we would have tackled the sort sinlge/album feature.
