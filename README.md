# Music Releases
Aim was to create a Spotify clone website containing info about newest album and single releases. 

## The problem
The problems we encountered:
- to write a comma between artists if there were more than one
- to connect a URL with the correct individual artist when there were more than one
- positioning the icons (heart, play, ellipses) in the center of the album image

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. 
- we used map() and conditional statements

What technologies did you use? 
- React, FlexBox, array.map() function, conditional statements

If you had more time, what would be next?
- render a list of popular playlists in a sidebar using another API response
- sort the albums from the singles and create two different sections on the site
- incorporate more information from the API response to make the site richer
