# "New Releases" music site

A React website that displays newly released singles and albums. One of my project during Technigo frontend boot camp.

## What did I do?

The task was to follow a design as closely as possible.

I started with looking at the json data and what kind of data I could get from it and how. I made a simple sketch of the structure and created components to use.

In this project I used React, JSON, JSX and CSS. For the layout I used grid. I used map to iterate through arrays from the JSON object.
