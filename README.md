# Music Releases

This weeks assignment was to build a music releases site using react. We had to create components and learn about component nesting. This project was done with pair programming.

## The problem

Our problem was to understand the usage of props and how to implement it. We solved it by asking our teammates for help and by googling a lot. We also found solutions on Technigo's stack overflow community.
