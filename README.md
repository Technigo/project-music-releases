# Music Releases

This week we have practiced React and creating components by using data from Spotify and working in pairs.

## The problem

First we agreed on what components we were gonna use, and made them one by one. We had some issues with placement of "keys" and the hover overlay. To solve the problems we faced we used google, Stackoverflow, our peers and code coaches.
If we had more time we would have tried doing parts from the red and black level.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
