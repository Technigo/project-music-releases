The project is a simple clone of Spotify showing a list of released albums and singles. I did it in pair programming together with Henrike Wiemker, whose site you can see here: https://github.com/HenrikeW.

The problem
The clone was built using React and it is the first React-project I ever did. A json-file with data on new releases was provided so the task was to create a React structure using components and passing in parts of the provided data using props. We also fulfilled specific design requirements: When hovering over an album cover, the cover gets darker and three white buttons show up in the middle of it. To achieve this, we used an overlay. If there are several artists who contributet to a release, all of them are shown and devided by a comma.

The site is repsonsive for mobile, tablet and desktop view and built with a mobile-first approach.
