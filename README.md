# Music Releases by Frida and Fiona

We used React to make an app showing new album and single releases, using data from Spotify. We followed a design of how the page should look and worked together in a pair throughout the whole build. 

## The problem

We started by looking at the design we had to follow and agreeing on each element of the app we needed. We then built the different components such as Album Cover and Album Name, which we mounted onto the album, and then onto the app. We styled the page with hover effects and made the page responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. If we had more time, we would have added a playlist.
