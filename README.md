# Music Releases
This projects is a React app than displays the new albums and singles from Spotify.

## The problem
We used .map to itterate over arrays to mount the album components and used React props to feed information to the components. We stated by building the album components and then added props to it. Then made the artist component and the n mounting it into the album component. If there was more time we would lower the oppacity on the play button and add a list of popular playlists.
