# Spotify Music Releases Page

The obejtive was to create a page that displays newly released spotify albums in a nice way using React. The data was pulled from a static Spotify API.

## The problem

The core idea was to create a copy of an already existing design. We decided to do one thing at a time so that we coould stay focused throughout the entire process.

We ran into a specific problem with adding a "," at the end of every index in an array. It took us quite a while to come up with a solution for this but ultimately we figured out that we could check the length of array with index (The index of the current element being processed in the array.).
