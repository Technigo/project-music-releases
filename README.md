# A 'New Releases' music site using React

I used React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases on Spotify.

The focus of this assignment was to practice with React, we got the downloaded response from the Spotify API which I could use, rather than calling the API myself.

## What I learned üß†

- How to write React components
- How to use `.map` to iterate over an array of data and mount many components
- How to use React props to feed information to components
- How to structure React projects into small chunks
- How to work with icons and changing shape/color whilst hoovering over them

## How I got started üí™üèº

I forked a repo, cloned it into my projects folder on my computer, opened up VS Code and the terminal, ran `cd code` to change into the code folder.
I installed the dependencies needed for react by running `npm install`
I ran the react development server by running `npm start`

## Requirements üß™

* The page should look as close as possible to the design provided from Spotify icluding icons (hearts, play button and more)*.
* You should display the following for each album; album cover image, album name, the name of each artist involved.
* When you hover over an album you should show a play button
* When you hover over the play button, it should grow.
* When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external url in the data
* When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external url in the data
* Your page should be response, showing 4 albums per row on desktop, 2 per row on tablet, and 1 per row on mobile.
