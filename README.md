# Music Releases

The goal for this week's project was to create a musical releases website, cloning the design of Spotify, and to also make it responsive with the mobile first approach.

For this we used data previously imported to the project from the Spotify API, and then added styling according to the project requirements. 

This was the first time Maria and Elsa worked with React to display information on a website, using components, props and dealing with npm. 


## The problem

We worked in pairs and structured our week with daily pair programming sessions using our newly aquired knowledge for both React and npm.

For each day we planned what we wanted to achieve and at the end of our session we ticked the "to-do"-list checkboxes. If you wish, please take a look at that to-do list below.

When we were stuck we checked for anwsers on Stack Overflow, asked our bootcamp buddies on how they solved the problem and used google to get past that problem "bump" to move forward programming our site.

### Here are requirements for this project: 
* Your app should have components
* Your page should look as close as possible to the design provided.
* You should display the following for each album:
    * album cover image
    * album name
    * the name of each artist involved with a comma between
* Hover effects:
    * When you hover over an album, it should go darker, and you should show a play button, a favourite button, and the ellipsis (see the design sketch)
    * When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketch)
    * Hovering an artist name or an album name should match the design sketch
* When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external url in the data
* When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external url in the data
* Your page should be responsive:
    * showing 4 albums per row on desktop
    * 2 per row on tablet
    * 1 per row on mobile.
* Create CSS rules or Javascript logic so that if there are only two artists you show a "&" between them, and if there are more than two artists, you show "," between all artists except the last two which should have "&".
