# Music Releases

This project was about building a page which shows new album and single releases. We used React and created components by using data from Spotify. 

## The problem

We used mostly pair-programming techniques to solve the tasks.  When we didnÂ´t work together (t.ex. driving/navigation) we explained to eachother the solutions that we had come up with. We also tried the "rubber duck"-method.
