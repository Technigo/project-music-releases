# Music Releases
This React-based app displays new album and single releases, featuring album cover images and artist names. It has hover effects, link to external URLs, and is responsive.

## The problem

The approach to the problem involved reviewing previous students' code, utilizing the Visual Studio Code extension ESLint, and pair-programming the React parts of the project while dividing the styling into separate branches. The plan involved dividing responsibilities and collaborating to complete the project efficiently. The technologies used were React and ESLint, as well as version control with Git branches. There was a a response from the Spotify API provided to us in the forked repository.
