# Music Releases

The assignment was to create a feed imitating spotify. We used spotify data, wrote JSX and used react. This was a pair project.
It was a challenge to understand the flow if react, but as the week went by it got easier. The biggest struggle was to wrap everything up in divs/spans in a correct way.
We are proud of our projects, even managing to complete the red requirements. We are fascinated by a weird problem, the name of the artist and the album title switch places. It is mounted in the correct order in app.js. We are fairly sure we could fix it by making the title into a own component.
