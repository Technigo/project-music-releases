# Music Releases
This is a music-site created with React. It was created during the Technigo Bootcamp as a pariprogramming project.

## The problem

During this project we learned how to do some basic React-programming. We created components which used data from an API and followed a design given by the Technigo Bootcamp. Following requirements were met:

**ðŸ”µ  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

- The app should have components
- *The page should look as close as possible to the design provided*.
- Following is displayed for each album:
    - album cover image
    - album name
    - the name of each artist involved with a comma between
- Hover effects:
    - When you hover over an album, it should go darker, and you should show a play button, a favourite button, and the ellipsis (see the design sketch)
    - When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketch)
    - Hovering an artist name or an album name should match the design sketch
- When the album is clicked, it should link to the album's external url in the data
- When an artist is clicked, it should link to the artist's external url in the data
- The page should be responsive:
    - showing 4 albums per row on desktop
    - 2 per row on tablet
    - 1 per row on mobile.

**ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**

- Create CSS rules or Javascript logic so that if there are only two artists you show a "&" between them, and if there are more than two artists, you show "," between all artists except the last two which should have "&":
    - *Teyana Taylor & Kehlani*
    - *Y2K, bbno$ & Enrique Iglesias*
- Lower the opacity of the play button icons and then when you hover over the play button, it should have full opacity

**âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals)**

- Using another API response which includes a list of popular playlists along with components to render a list of playlists in a sidebar.
- Sorted the albums from the singles and create two different sections on the site
