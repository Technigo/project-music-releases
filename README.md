# Build a 'New Releases' music site using React, week 9

This week's project was to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.
[Live project](https://music-releases-emmie.netlify.com/)

## In this project I practiced

- How to write React components
- How to use `.map` to iterate over an array of data and mount many components
- How to use React props to feed information to components
- How to structure React projects into small chunks

## Design

The task was to follow the design screenshots as closely as possible. We've provided icons for the play, heart and more info icons when hovering on an album.
