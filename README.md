# Music Releases
This project was made by creating components and using data from Spotify libarry.
The page shows new album and new single releases. The site is repsonsive. 

## The problem

As react is case sensitive the biggest challenge was to keep all files with the correct naming, importing the correct file names to avoid the errors. 

It's the first project built with React.
