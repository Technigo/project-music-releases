Project week 9 @ Technigo Bootcamp 2019 was to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.

In the code/src/data.json an API response from Spotify is included which contains data for 50 recent releases. Our task was to use this, along with .map() to mount an 'Album' component for each album. Within those components our app could should have a structure like this:  

App component which has the data  
Album component which is rendered using .map() and which passes the album data into using props.   
Artist component which is rendered using .map() using each item in the artists array, inside the Album component to show the artist name and a link.
