# Music Releases
This week we practiced React and creating components by using data from Spotify. We built a page which shows new album and single releases. This project was done by pair programming. 

## The problem
✓ Your app should have components
✓ Your page should look as close as possible to the design provided.
✓ You should display the following for each album:
- album cover image
- album name
- the name of each artist involved with a comma between

✓ Hover effects:
- When you hover over an album, it should go darker, and you should show a play button, a favourite button, and the ellipsis (see the design sketch)
- When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketch)
- Hovering an artist name or an album name should match the design sketch

✓ When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external URL in the data

✓ When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external URL in the data

✓ Your page should be responsive:
- showing 4 albums per row on desktop
- 2 per row on tablet
- 1 per row on mobile.

To have the icons placed over the album cover was a challenge. We solved it by creating an icon-container. The other major challenge was the hover effects for the different states but we got there in the end.
