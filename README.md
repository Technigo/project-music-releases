# Music Releases
On this weeks project Ylva Karlsson and Emma Holtegaard Hansen worked together with making a project where spotify data and React is used to create list of new albums and singles. 

## The problem
This week, we only worked using pair programming. We communicated a lot, and used a trello board to keep the project structured. We found it easy and useful, to keep track of progress. If we had more time, we would attempt the stretchgoals (add a playlist sidebar and sort albums from singles.) We might refactor the code, so everything is in it's own component. Ylva would also add a favicon. 

Tools used:
- React
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Trello
