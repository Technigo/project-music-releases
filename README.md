# Music Releases

This project's purpose was to create a new music releases web page using Spotify's API from 2019. It was created by Bruna Araujo and Emelie Lindblom using React with multiple components.

## The problem

We approached the project by dividing it into components and handled them individually. We had to figure out how to mount the components and get our data to display. After researching and with the support of our team, we tried out different alternatives and found the solutions we needed. Since it was our first React project, we had difficulties deploying it into Netlify, but we were able to fix after inspecting the deployment process.
