The task given us was to create a site in React displaying music releases, using an API from Spotify. 

It was a co-operation between Hannah Ek & Sofia Gerdmar and was done with a pair programming aproach.

We started by discussing the project and how we should build it, as well as starting dividing the different components between each other, as well as deiciding on the structure of the page.

We worked on practising the use of React and buildning a site containing props and components. 

If we had more time, we would have added a playlist feature along with some more styling.
