# Music Releases
This project was the first time using React. The aim was to create a music site displaying images of albums and the album and the artist and use data from an API to display all this information. The focus was components and props and how to structure a website using components and passing in props to these components.

## The problem

First the structure of the website was decided by breaking different parts of the website into small blocks for example header, releaselist etc) and make them components. After that the data was retrieved and mapped in order to pass in to the different HTML elements. Then different hover effects were done for each item such as image, button icons etc. CSS Grid was used to align the releases. If there was more time the opacity of the play icon would be done for hover state.
