# Music Releases
This week we made a website showing 50 new album using api from Spotify data, as a pair-programming project for Technigo bootcamp.
The main goal was to practice using React. 

## The problem

We started with fetching the right api for each component. When we were done with building the bare bone structure using api, we added css for each component. 
We struggled a bit with css issues such as darkening the background image since it was bit different to deal with them in React compared to CSS for HTML. We looked at suggestions on Stackoverflow and code-alongs from our teachers.
