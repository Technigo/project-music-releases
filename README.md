# Music Releases

This project was done in collaboration with Ã…sa Sieurin using pair programming. The focus of the project was to get started with React and be introduced to how to:

- write JSX
- create React components
- use `.map` to iterate over an array of data and mount many components
- use React props to feed information to components.

The assignment was to create a React app that:

- shows new album and singles releases
- follows the provided design as closely as possible
- was done in pair programming


As a personal stretch goal we decided to not use the data provided in the project from Technigo from 2019, but instead fetched the actual current releases from March -22. Since setting up a renewable token using OAuth to continously update the new releases ended up being too complex for the level we're at, we instead made one API call and saved the data in a new file.
