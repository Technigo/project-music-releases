# Music Releases
This week's assignment was to build a responsive page which shows new album and single releases using data from Spotify. Our first project practicing React. 

## The problem

We started by creating a main app component which we connected to our smaller components: header, album and icons. We displayed the JSX elements for the music albums, like the album cover, the album and the artist name and icons, by using the map method on the array of the data that comes from a downloaded response from the Spotify API. We used CSS Grid to make the page responsive. Since it was our first time working with React we learned a lot about how to break up a project in smaller modules/components and how to connect these to one another.
