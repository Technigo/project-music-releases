# Music Releases
The project aim was to practise react and create components by using data from spotify, resulting in a page showing new albums and single releases. 

## The problem

This was our first time coding in react and so took a little longer to figure out how the parts interacted. 
With more time we would have tried to do more than one of the stretch goals, e.g. sorted the albums from the singles to create two different sections.
