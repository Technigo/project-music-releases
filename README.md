# Music Releases
This project was to build a page which shows new album and single releases. We did this by using React and created components by using data from Spotify.

## The problem

We used React and started to create the components we needed, and passed them on to App.js to make sure we received the result we are looking for. After we got the data we needed from the API we styled the page so it followed the specified design.

We learned a lot about React and the logic behind. If we had more time we would have worked more with the CSS styling, getting the "&" sign when several artists are included in a release.
