# Music Releases
This project was made as part of Technigo bootcamp by Sandra Wall√©n and Siri Hemsley. 

The assignment was to create a music releases site based on an API response from Spotify, using React (for the first time).

## The problem

We quite quickly manage to display the data on the site and create a grid with all albums. We struggled a bit with figuring out how to iterate over arrays using map, but once we understood we were able to simplfy our code and clean it up to make the App.js very dry and only referring to the different components and passing the data through props. 

We were able to advance to the strech goals and also incorporate the playlist section which went a lot quicker, now that we knew how to do it. 

## If you had more time, what would be next?
- We would have liked to make the site look a bit more like a website, with a top bar, menu, header etc. 
- We would also have sorted the albums from the singles, since this was the only strech goal we didn't do.
