# Music Releases
This project was made during the Technigo Bootcamp. The assignment was to build a music releases site, with data from a provided JSON file. 
The project was built with React.

## The problem
We started off with trying to build different components and then linking them together. Then we tried to get the data, and ran in to some issues with figure out the right path to fetch the data. 
In the end we needed to redo some of the code and split it into more components, to make it more clear and easy to read. 

For the next React project we will plan the structure better of the components before starting to code. 
We have used the Technigo resources (lectures, teachers, reading material) and also Google of course. 
If we had more time we would add more information from the JSON file, mostly for practice. It would also be fun to try to sort the albums/singles.
