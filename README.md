# Music Releases
This project is part of the Tecnigo Bootcamp. This week's project is to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.
We have worked with a fixed design and we had to follow the given design as closely as possible. 
We have worked pair-programming. 

In this project we have lerned: 
- How to write React components
- How to use `.map` to iterate over an array of data and mount many components
- How to use React props to feed information to components

## The problem

We started building each "card" for every album and then added images, artist name,song name and made components for the icons. We struggeled with how to change color of the svg's. If we had more time we would work more on the hovereffects of the card/icons.
