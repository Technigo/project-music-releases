# Music Releases
Music release page by Vio Szabo and Frida Munther Gustavson. 

The week's project consisted in building a music release page using React. 

## The problem

The assignment was to use components and pass props. The site should show album image covers, the album names and the artist names separated with a comma. On hover, icons should show and the play button should grow.
We used a combination of React and CSS to solve this problem.
