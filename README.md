# Music Releases
This project, of a Music Releases, was made as a Week 9 project for Technigo bootcamp. 
The goal of the project was to create a Music Releases site that would have a similar design to Spotify, using React and  API data from Spotify.

## The problem

We iterated through data.json with map to get the albums, images, and artists. We created several components for the different parts of the page (album image, title, artist, etc), and mounted them with props to pass in the information for each album. We styled it with flex box to make it responsive.
