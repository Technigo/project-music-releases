# Music Releases
Use react to show different data from an API, all new release with album cover, album title and artists invovled. Use components and mount in the App.
Create it while pair programming.

## The problem
We had a design to follow, with different hover effects to apply.
We used components for Header and Album and mounted these in the App component.
We used Stack Overflow, previous students project and our teammates to solve the problems we ran into.
If we had more time we would have tried to add the sidebar with playlists.
