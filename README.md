# Music Releases
This week we practiced React and creating components using data from Spotify. 
We built a page that shows new albums and single releases. This was a team task and I worked with Peki. We worked as a team from Monday to Thursday but decided on Friday's standup that we would finish the project individually to get more practice working with CSS. The project was excellent, and everything went super smoothly with Peki.

## The problem

At first, it was super hard to understand how React works, but after seeing some code from the previous student, we started to understand it more and more. We worked as much as possible simultaneously with the same file to share knowledge while working.
