# Build a 'New Releases' music site using React

This week's project is to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.

Since the focus of this assignment is to practice with React, we've downloaded a response from the Spotify API which you can use, rather than calling the API yourself.

## Requirements ðŸ§ª

* *Your page should look as close as possible to the design provided*.
* You should display the following for each album; album cover image, album name, the name of each artist involved.
* When you hover over an album you should show a play button
* When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketches)
* When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external url in the data
* When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external url in the data
* Your page should be response, showing 4 albums per row on desktop, 2 per row on tablet, and 1 per row on mobile.
* Code follows Technigoâ€™s code guidelines.
* Contribute by helping others with this project on Stack Overflow.
* If selected; demo your solution for your team.


# Solution ðŸŽ¨

I build a responsive app for mobile, tablets and laptops. I used provided Spotify API and try to make it look as close to provided design.
