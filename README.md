# Music Releases

Assigment was to learn the basic of React and be able to build components writing JSX and JS to make a music release site using API content from Spotify.

# How we built it - What we learned

We aimed for the red level of this project.

The work was made in pair-programming which we were able to do almost during the entire project. Itâ€™s a very nice to be able to discuss the problems directly and working on how to solve them together.

We started by creating a main component that would contain two smaller components.The album cards are generated by using the map() method to fetch data (50 different albums) from the json file. Clicking on the artist name and album will take to the respective page.

This was a good oportunity to practice and learn more about CSS, like using className to make it work with React, scaling elements and applying filter effects on hover.

# The problem

If we had more time, we would probably schedule another 1:1 code session to be explained how to work with the components structure in a better way. It is not clear to us. Also the mapping of arrays we need more time to fully grasp.

We had some issues with scaling the play button and the solution was to add one more container to the album card and also set the hover effect on that container to affect both the album cover and the play button.
