My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
We're happy with the result this week and we feel that it matches the instructions well.
It took some thinking to understand where to start, but after getting some help it felt quite logical.


Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
We added the function that adds ',' and '&' if there are more than one artist on the album, but we're not sure how this should work (or if it's working). Since an album has one artist name, that can be multiple words or artists, we don't understand when an extra artist is added and a comma or & is needed. If there are multiple artists on an album the artist name already has commas or &.
