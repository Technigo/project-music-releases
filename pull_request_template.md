My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
We're happy with the result this week and we feel that it matches the instructions well.
It took some thinking to understand where to start, but after getting some help it felt quite logical until we realized that we didn't loop thorugh all the artists (which we thought we did). 

The hardest part was to figure out how to .map the artists to be able to show more than one as seperate links.
And not so much the .map itself but where to put the code in order for it to work.


Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
Is there are correct way to build the code when using multiple components? 
Where to .map, if putting props from different components in one component is ok etc.?
